# AZ Road to Open Tournament Bracket

A web-based tournament bracket for Arizona high school basketball. This is a side project I built for my old high school to make it easier to view matchups and follow the tournament as it progresses, and was created to give back to my high school community.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** — app framework + dev server
- **Firebase** — database (and authentication, if enabled)

## Features
- Live bracket updates (as games are entered/updated)
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Simple structure for managing teams, games, and rounds

## Project Setup

### 1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
